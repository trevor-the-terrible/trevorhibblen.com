## Summary

Joined as the second dev on a 3 person start-up. Designed, architected, developed and supported new features, services and internal tooling, from client/server code, to our mobile apps, to our database. Continually enhanced scalability to meet new requirements as the app grew. Briefly operated as a sort of "micro cto" after startup was acquired. This leaned much more into management and high level integration with other departments, as well as my usual workload. But I felt my skills were better fit in development and coaching new engineers.

## Responsibilities

- Architect, maintain, develop and design new services and features.
- __Multiple__ platform and database provider migrations 😓
- Optimized schemas, queries and developed new tooling to handle scalability challenges. Our average client-size grew from companies with a few hundred employees to 100k+.

## Principle technologies
  - Node.JS
  - Express
  - Vue
  - Webpack
  - PostgreSQL
  - MongoDB
  - RabbitMQ
  - Heroku
  - AWS
  - Objective-C
  - Java (android)
