## Summary

Joined as the first hire on a tiny start-up. So my role changed dramatically overtime. Early, I designed, developed and supported new customer-facing features, internal services and infrastructure. That was everything from client/server code, native mobile apps, database architecture, to testing and deployment pipelines. As the app grew, I worked to enhance scalability to fit our needs. After acquisition, for about 2 years, I operated as a sort of _micro_ CTO and manager over the growing team. But, I encouraged the company to hire for that role. By the end I was filling technical gaps on feature teams, mentoring our new developers, conducting spikes, and developing new tooling and infrastructure geared to improve our long-term scalability.
