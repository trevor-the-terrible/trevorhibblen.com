## Summary

We were a C# shop that converged on Node.JS. I loved this job because I was constantly exposed to new technology and teams excited to try new things. I mostly developed and supported one of our flagship products. I also ported many of our .Net and Node.Js apps to work "in the cloud." And I got to lead the team developing patterns and tools to manage those new deployments, since this was not as well supported by AWS at the time.

## Responsibilities

- Developed and designed multiple applications, services and features
- Designed and implemented AWS infrastructure to host company applications
- Led initiative to port existing .NET applications to Node.JS
- Supported legacy applications in Classic ASP and ASP.NET (MVC and WebForms)
- Mentored junior developers and managed pull requests across majority of codebase

## Principle technologies

  - C#
  - Node.JS
  - Express
  - Bootstrap
  - Angular 1
  - jQuery
  - MSSQL
  - MongoDB
  - AWS
